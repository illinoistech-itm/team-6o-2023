# Declared Tools, Frameworks, and Applications for Coding:
This document will include all tools, frameworks, and coding applications that will be used to develop our web application. 

## Database: 

- Our team will be ultilizing **MariaDB** for our application's database and schema.

## Package Manager: 

- Our team will be ultilizing **NPM(Node Package Manager)** as our package manager.

## Web/App Server: 

- Our team will be ultilizing **Nginx** for our web server.

## Programming Language:

- Our team has decided to use a mix of **JavaScript** and **PugJS** to create our web application.

- We moved to PugJs because EJS was great but overly complicated. Some of our team has had experience with Pug, that is why we are using it. It is very similar to EJS, but easier to read and implement.

- PugJS Is a template engine that gives us the ability to generate **HTML** with plain JavaScript. Similar to EJS.

- Moving forward, use the folder, Pug-Build to intiate the application. The Test-Build folder contains our old EJS work. We will be using the Test-Build for reference moving forward. In order to run the application, perform the following steps:

1. Download **credentials.json** file from the Discord group chat. Specifically, it is located within the **#secrets** channel. That is where all project files will be shared. 
2. After downloading **credentials.json**, place it in the **Pug_Build folder**. Specifically, you want to place it in the **data** folder located within the **Pug_Build**.
    
    So, the file architecture that you will follow: **code -> Pug_Build -> data ->** *place credentials.json here*
    
3. **Pull** current code from source of truth (team-6o repository).
4. Open up a new terminal window within VS Code.
5. **cd** into **code** folder , then **cd** into the **Pug-Build** folder.
6. In the terminal, Type in command, **npm i** to install all dependencies. 
7. In the terminal, Type in command, **npm run dev** to run apppication.
8. In a browser, go to **http://localhost:3000**.
9. In the terminal, press **ctrl + C**. Then type y for yes or n for no. This command stops the application. 

## Webpage Frameworks:
- Our team will be ultilizing **Express** as our web application framework. Express is a web framework designed specifically for node.js.

- **Bootstrap** for **css** implementation.
Bootstrap gives our team the ability to add css to our Java ServerPages (JSP).

## Runtime Environment
- Our team will ultilize **Node.js** for our runtime environment. This will alow us to build a scalable and dynamic web application.
