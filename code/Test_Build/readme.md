# Web App Test Build

## How to run the web application
You will need to have nodejs installed to run this application.

First, within the "data" folder add the credentials.json file with the credentials for the application.

Next, change directory into this directory (Test_Build) and run `npm i` to install all needed dependancies.

You are are then able to run the command `npm run dev` to start the development script.
This makes the project auto-restart whenever you save new code that affects it.

Alternatively, you can run `npm run start` for the app when you do not want to adjust any code and run it as intended.
