# How work will flow

- Each team member will communicate with the group as they complete each task.
Providing updates when issues arise, or reaching task checkpoints. Once each task is complete, team members must get current Project Manager's approval for completion of designated task.

- Each member is assigned a role and it is their responsability to complete each task under designated role.

- Team members are encouraged to help each other with tasks but this is not required.

# Communication rules and methods

- All project-related communications must be made through group discord. Meaning various project updates, scheduling meeting times, or questions/issues about project/project tasks.

- Each team member must attend project meetings in order to stay up to date with their tasks and project related work.

- In order to be excused from a meeting, team members must give notice to the group at least 24 hours before the meeting. It is the excused team member's responsibility to find out what they missed in the meeting. This can be done via communication with current PM (project manager).

- Any inclination of racism, prejudice, bullying, or harassment will not be tolerated. All team members must maintain respectful behavior throughout interactions with other team members.

# Consequences

- If three meetings are missed without a 24 hour notice, each team member in violation of this rule will be excluded from further project work. They will have to do their own project by themselves.

- If a team member(s) shows any inclination of racism, prejudice, bullying, or harassment, the team member will be kicked from the project and the instructor will be notified. 

# Restoration methods

- At first, both parties of current issue will have a group meeting with the current project manager. The current project manager will try to resolve the conflict in this meeting. If conflict is not able to be resolved by project manager, the conflict will be lifted to the course instructor. Then the course instructor will determine how the conflict should be handled
